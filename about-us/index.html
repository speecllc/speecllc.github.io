			<figcaption><h4>About Us</h4>
				<p><em>Stanton Psycho-Educational Evaluation Consultants</em> goal is to provide objective, high quality psycho-educational evaluations that can be used as a tool for assisting with developing a targeted educational plan for your child or student. A comprehensive psycho-evaluation will provide educational information that conceptualizes the strengths and needs of your child or student, identifies strengths and needs in specific areas of underlying psychological processes, and how that impacts educational performance. A comprehensive psycho-educational evaluation can provide recommendations for targeted interventions that aid you and your child’s school-based multidisciplinary team in understanding the type and level of educational programming required to meet the needs of your child in order to facilitate positive academic progress.</p>
